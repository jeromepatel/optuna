# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://help.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates
# This is an example with only required properties:
version: 2
update_configs:
  - package_manager: "python"
    directory: "/"
    update_schedule: "live"
  # Keep Dockerfile up to date, batching pull requests weekly
  - package_manager: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    update_schedule: "weekly"
